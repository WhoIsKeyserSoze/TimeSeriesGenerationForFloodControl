This README.md will interest you if you want to add a new Neural Network Algorithm.

(ALGO = your algorithm name)

Follow the following steps to add one :

* Copy paste the content of the folder named "TEMPLATE_module" in a folder you will name
  "ALGO_module", with ALGO being the name of your algorithm. Basically, each time you see
  template in file names or folder name, make sure to replace them by the name of your 
  algorithm.
* Modify the "template.py" and "templateData.py" contents by following the instructions
  in them.
* Make sure the save of your neural network have to be in a folder named "ALGO_storage" 
  and this folder being placed in the folder "ALGO_module".
