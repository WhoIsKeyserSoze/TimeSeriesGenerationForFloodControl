# TimeSeriesGenerationForFloodControl
The objective of this project is to analyze time series of height and flow of water from rivers, to create predictive models representing their evolutions, in particular during rapid floods, then apply these models to flood prediction, and generate new time series when situations change. A secondary objective is to develop an API so that these prediction and generation functions can be called by an external framework.
